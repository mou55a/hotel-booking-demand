## Abstract:
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?
This project aims to minimize hotels and resorts loss due to their clients cancel their reservation by creating using data science and machine learning techniques to predict the customer behavior and know if they will cancel their reservations in the future or not.


## Getting Data:
This data had been downloaded from  Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.
